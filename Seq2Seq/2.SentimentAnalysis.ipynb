The scenes with Raines modeling are very well captured, the mood music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is charming as Cristina's pal, but when Raines moves into a creepy Brooklyn Heights brownstone (inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor), things really start cooking. The neighbors, including a fantastically wicked Burgess Meredith and kinky couple Sylvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, are a diabolical lot, and Eli Wallach is great fun as a wily police detective. The movie is nearly a cross-pollination of \"Rosemary's Baby\" and \"The Exorcist\"--but what a combination! Based on the best-seller by Jeffrey Konvitz, \"The Sentinel\" is entertainingly spooky, full of shocks brought off well by director Michael Winner, who mounts a thoughtfully downbeat ending with skill. ***1/2 from **** .......recreated this text...... bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by raines later of tv's road as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a smile who is to pay for her attempted by the to hell the scenes with raines are very well captured the mood music is perfect deborah is charming as pal but when raines moves into a creepy brooklyn heights inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor things really start cooking the neighbors including a fantastically wicked meredith and kinky couple sylvia miles beverly are a diabolical lot and is great fun as a police detective the movie is nearly a cross of rosemary's baby and the exorcist but what a combination based on the best by jeffrey the sentinel is spooky full of shocks brought off well by director michael winner who a downbeat ending with skill 1 2 from\n"
